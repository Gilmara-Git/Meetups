# MeetUp application

Buiding a SPA ( Single Page Application) with React
npx create-react-app my-app

Routing:
React Route V5
npm install react-router-dom@5

Defined the routes with <Route>. Added the 'exact' property to show the exact route.
Wrapped it around <Switch> to show the active page
Used the <Link> component provided by the react-router-dom instead of the Anchor tag <a>, so, it prevent the browser from sending a request, and it changes the url in the url bar and loads the appropriate component on the screen just with React and Javascript.

## Styling the App
'Create React app' gives us a feature that allows us to style our component in a way that it wont clash with other components even if a ClassName is named the same, which is css modules.  This is achieved because the styles as scope when using Css Modules. It dynamically creates/modifies our className to a unique name.
So, that is how I am styling this app. 
Example how the file should be named:
MainNavigation.module.css
When you import it, you can import as 'classes' and this is an object of properties that can be used to style the component. 


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
